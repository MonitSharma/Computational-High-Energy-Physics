## Content

### [Latttice Based Equation of State](https://github.com/MonitSharma/Computational-High-Energy-Physics/tree/main/Lattice%20Based%20Equation%20Of%20State) :

This project simulates Equation of State with Baryon Number, Electric charge and Strangeness Chemical Potential. 

This is an implementation of the paper **"Lattice-based Equation of State at finite Baryon number, Electric charge and Strangeness chemical potential"** by J.Noronha-Hostler, P.Parotto, C. Ratti and J.M Stafford

### [Equation of State with Critical Point QCD](https://github.com/MonitSharma/Computational-High-Energy-Physics/tree/main/EOS%20with%20Critical%20Point%20QCD):

Lattice QCD simulations and finding critical point in QCD transitions

This is an updated version of the **BEST Collaboration** program producing an EoS matching lattice QCD at $\mu_B=0$, and containing a critical point in the $3D$ Ising universality class, in a parametrized form. It allows for different choices of constraints on the shape of the critical line, which reduce the number of parameters, as well as the inclusion of no critical point, corresponding to a Taylor expansion of lattice QCD result only.

Moreover, it allows for the choice of strangeness neutrality conditions: $n_S = 0$ && $n_Q = 0.4 n_B$ or the case of only baryon number: $\mu_S = \mu_Q = 0$

### [Addressing LHC problems via Machine Learning](https://github.com/MonitSharma/Computational-High-Energy-Physics/tree/main/Coursera%20Course%20Solutions):

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest data generation machine for the time being. It doesnâ€™t produce the big data, the data is gigantic. Just one of the four experiments generates thousands gigabytes per second. The intensity of data flow is only going to be increased over the time. So the data processing techniques have to be quite sophisticated and unique.

In this online course students are introduced into the main concepts of the Physics behind those data flow so the main puzzles of the Universe Physicists are seeking answers for will be much more transparent. Of course the major stages of the data processing pipelines are scrutinized, and focus on the role of the Machine Learning techniques for such tasks as track pattern recognition, particle identification, online real-time processing (triggers) and search for very rare decays. The assignments of this course gives the opportunity to apply skills in the search for the New Physics using advanced data analysis techniques.
